## Introduction
Knvim is  a config for NeoVim, with a goal of providing an IDE like environment for stduents. It's focuses on aspects like Syntax-Highlighting, File Tree, Terminal, Fuzzy-Search etc. It doesn't include Auto-Completation, Spell Checking,formatting, Auto git records or anything which can harm essential practices of a students.

## Why ?
Most of the popular NeoVim configurations (ex- KickStart, Lazy, NvChad, Astro) offers an excellent setup for "devlopers" not for students. Auto-completation, Spell/Syntax checking make a habit of not worrying about actual syntax. Auto formatting can stop the practice of code readbility. Auto git records makes no sense of learning actual git comands and their parameters. This thinngs considered as a bad practice when learning the codign or a new language. Therefore i worked on this config , which may offer a stuible enviromnent without wasteing time to reconfigureing it.
